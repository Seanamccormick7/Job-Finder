# Job Finder App

Made with React + Typescript + Vite
This application allows users to search for remote developer jobs. Users can filter results, see expanded information for each listing, and bookmark specific listings.

Implemented API fetching with some sample data. The project also uses URL state management for bookmarks and sharing, as well as custom hooks for debouncing requests and extended state management. 
Also implements React-Query for caching and local storage for persistent data.
