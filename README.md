# Job Finder App

Made with React + Typescript + Vite
This application allows users to search for remote developer jobs. Users can filter results, see expanded information for each listing, and bookmark specific listings.

Implemented API fetching with sample data from @ByteGrad. The project also uses URL state management for bookmark sharing, as well as custom hooks for debouncing requests and extended state management. 
React-Query was used for caching and local storage was used for persistent data.
